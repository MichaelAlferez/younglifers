                                <span>"Growing up, I always felt something missing in my life. No matter how much I tried to fill it with friends, achievements, or material possessions, there was a void I couldn’t explain. It was during one of the most challenging times of my life—when I was struggling with self-doubt and purpose—that I found God’s light.

A friend invited me to join a youth service at Living One Global Ministries. At first, I was hesitant, unsure if I would fit in. But from the moment I walked through those doors, I felt an overwhelming sense of peace and belonging. The worship songs, the words of encouragement, and the love of the community touched my heart in ways I had never experienced before.

Through prayer and fellowship, I realized that God had been with me all along, waiting for me to open my heart. I began to see His presence in my life—in the smallest blessings, in the strength to face difficulties, and in the love of those around me. My life transformed as I started to trust Him fully, letting go of my fears and embracing the plans He has for me."</span>
